# Worldnect

The aim of Worldnect was to be a chat app that allows users to create chat groups and add other users to it.
<br /><br />

Firebase was used as a backend and I made use of chatengine but unfortunately, at the time when I was practicing making this app, chatengine no longer offered free plans.
<br /><br />

I have completed the code and reached a point where I need to test it but due to the circumstances mentioned above, I wasn't getting any POST and GET requests so I decided to stop until maybe chatengine offers free plans again.
